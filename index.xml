      <description>why comments are important in programming Commenting involves placing Human Readable Descriptions inside of computer programs detailing what the Code is doing. Proper use of commenting can make code maintenance much easier, as well as helping make finding bugs faster. Further, commenting is very important when writing functions that other people will use.
yes copying code is not a problem, but you know what the problem is ??. well if you not comments the documatation and why this code working or anything, there is a big problem here if you open you project after a years then are not able to understand your own code and you are unable to understand the code which you copy.</description>

      <description>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.</description>

      <description>We underestimate what the understanding of basic array methods can do. It saves us a lot of time when building projects. At least, I feel that way, because most of the features that you build in any project boil down to manipulating the array of values.
In this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing some array methods which I&amp;rsquo;ve found most useful and must know, along with examples.
map() map() method returns a new array populated with results from calling a function provided for every element in the calling array.</description>

      <description>Synchronous vs asynchronous programming and their use cases Synchronous and asynchronous are two different types of programming implementations that confuse a lot of new developers. This knowledge is very essential to create performant and scalable systems.
In short, a synchronous program blocks further operation till the current task execution has been completed. On the other hand, an asynchronous program allows to start multiple tasks at once, then progress and finish in overlapping time.</description>

      <description>Tor Browser routes your web traffic through the Tor network, making it private and anonymous. When you use the Tor Browser, the connection to the website you are viewing is encrypted and protected from network surveillance and traffic analysis.
Using Tor Browser comes with few drawbacks. Browsing the web over Tor is slower than a regular Internet connection, and some major web sites block Tor users. Also, in some countries, Tor is illegal or blocked by the government-enforced firewall.</description>
