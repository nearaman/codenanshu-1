Learning CSS can be a frustrating experience sometime. One of the best things about learning to code is that people who are good at coding also happen to have the skills to make games that teach other people to code.

Here are some games which help you to master CSS.

### 1\. [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)

This game is about Flexbox and it covers flex properties like `align-items`, `justify-content`, `align-content`, `flex-direction`, `align-self`, `flex-wrap`, `flex-flow` and order in 24 different levels.

Yeah, last level is bit challenging ðŸ˜‰

### 2\. [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/)

Here we use Flexbox to position the heroâ€™s crossbow and hit the zombies and survive along the game. Each section unravels part of the plot, gives you expertise over a new flexbox concept, and presents zombie survival challenges that force you to solidify your new skills like your life depends on it.

### 3\. [Flexbox defense](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/)

Flexbox defense is based on the classic tower defence games, but to place our items we write CSS instructions. We use the justify-content property on the main container to move the single towers into effective positions.

### 4\. [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)

### 5\. [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/)

CSS Battle is more of an online challenge than an actual CSS practice game, the objective is to write HTML and CSS code to replicate the given target image in the least code possible. This game is constantly updated with new challenges. It has a global ranking system and the ability to re-play each challenge so you can improve your own results.

### 6\. [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/)
