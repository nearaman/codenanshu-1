## Vue 3.2 promises a speed boost üöÄ

Vue 3.2, a new release of the popular JavaScript framework, offers better performance as well as improvements to single file components and web components. Vue 3.2 was announced on August 5.

For web components, Vue 3.2 introduces a **defineCustomElement** method to create native custom elements using Vue component APIs. Developers can build Vue-powered UI component libraries that can be used with any framework or no framework at all.

For single file components üòé (SFC), also known as ‚Äú.vue‚Äù files, two features have graduated from experimental status to stable: <script setup>, a compile-time syntactic sugar to improve ergonomics when using Composition API inside SFCs, and <style> v-bind, enabling component state-driven dynamic CSS values in SFC <style> tags.
